        <h3>FOSDEM 2012</h3>
        <p>With a small group we went to FOSDEM 2012 in Brussels. It was <em>very cool</em>, and I don't mean the weather (it was minus eight Centigrade). We tried to enjoy the entire weekend, especially including the beer event on friday night in Délirium Café. On saturday and sunday we attended many interesting talks about all kinds of open source software, such as virtualization, embedded applications, managing high-impact changes in distributions, building communities and many, many more.</p>
        <p>I enjoyed the visit very much and will be there next year if possible.</p>

      <h3>SAG2012W</h3>
      <p>Last saturday January 14th was the <a href=/sag2012w>SAG2012W</a> at RevSpace, The Hague. Being an official association, we had our first general assembly in the hour before noon. After that, we had lunch and started with the public program.</p>
      <p>The chairman of the day, Marcel van Driel, introduced the people giving the keynotes. The first two keynotes were "Innovation as an art" by Marcel Wendt and "Language workbenches" by Tobi Vollebregt.</p>
      <p>During the break the projects results were presented: concept art of a new Laserharp prototype with 20 rays, a web-based IDE for embedded development for ARM 9, the .projectlodge website and a brand new project: an app for Bridge system cards.</p>
      <p>After the break Maartje de Jonge told us more about the need for an app for Bridge system cards, and last but not least was the talk "Programming Amish" by Timon Vonk.</p>
      <p>At the end of the program Joost Elfering invited us to go visit FOSDEM 2012, after that we enjoyed a chat with a drink. We are looking back on a succesful gathering, attended by nearly 25 people.</p>

      <h3>BOOT party</h3>
      <p>This is the moment we've been anticipating: the official launch of the association projectlodge. We gathered here at RevSpace and listened to Bert's speech, followed up by the launch meeting itself.</p>
      <p>We presented three administrative bodies: the board, the supervisory board and the auditing committee. The board members are Bert Meerman (chairman), Ynte Kramer (treasurer) and Roeland van Ochten (secretary). The supervisory board members are Nick van Manen, Joost Elfering and Timon Vonk. The auditing committee members are Michiel Meijer and Tobi Vollebregt.</p>
      <p>The projectlodge is now an official association, and we are happy to mention that fifteen people signed up to be a member that same evening. We all had a pleasant evening and talked a lot about each others interests and potential projects.</p>

      <h3>Statutes review</h3>
      <p>Four weeks ago we asked the participants for feedback on the current version and this was the last day for feedback to be put into the statutes. We received some feedback, a request to put definitions at the top for clarity and some spelling mistakes.</p>
      <p>These changes marked the start of another four week term: if no-one objects, the statutes are final and the association will be launched.</p>

        <h3>Laserharp at Technival</h3>
	<p>Saturday, September 10th was Technival, a fancy fair of technology hosted by OGD. Sharing the area with a number of Xbox stands, Kinect games and a 3D-printer we demonstrated the Laserharp. It was in the same state as during BAM2011S, sound provided by a nice stereo set and an extra item: a Theremin, provided by Bas van der Noordt (B-sting).</p>
	<p>An amazing number of visitors actually put on the white gloves and played a few notes. Some of them asked a lot of questions how the heck the Laserharp actually works which we were happy to explain, aided by status-LEDs, oscilloscope and making the rays visible with haze-in-a-can. A number of them also took a projectlodge minicard with them and we hope some of them will join the Laserharp project.</p>

        <h3>The first Railcoach release</h3>
        <p>Today the Railcoach team had a coding day and we decided to go live! At the moment, the "real" site and beta are the same, but expect new beta versions soon. Since a train wagon won't move by itself we will name the Railcoach releases after railway engines. Starting with Adler, being the first German steam engine (and A the beginning of the alphabet).</p>

        <h3>BAM2011S, the summer meeting</h3>
	<p>Saturday, July the 2nd at RevSpace was the Bi-Annual Meeting 2011 Summer, the third half yearly meeting. After the lunch, Bert gave his Kinect-controlled presentation about the projectlodge. This gimmick carried the message "yes, you can!", and when it matures, the finicky controls will soon be forgotten.</p>
	<p>After the first break we had three more talks. Joost told about the Railcoach project, including the fact the site went live early June. Roeland gave a short talk on the current infrastructure and the planning. Timon and Joost presented a new project: the Tech Event Calendar. It’s goal is to create a single place where to look for upcoming technology-related events.</p>
	<p>After the second break Hans did a lightning talk about electric power economy, especially how apps interfacing with smart power meters can help identify power-hungry household equipment.</p>
	<p>Since there were no others interested in giving lightning talks, the next item was the board presenting the mission/vision statement, the first draft statutes and regulations on elections. A few useful suggestions from the audience were adopted into the mission/vision statement, which was then accepted by acclamation. The audience gave much feedback on the draft statutes, we took notes and decided to do a thorough rewrite.</p>
	<p>The last item on the agenda was tech demonstrations with chats and drinks. Many projects were represented, among which the laserharp got a fair share of attention. Most of the fifteen people present talked nearly until dusk and we all had a pleasant time.</p>

        <h3>The BETA site is live!</h3>
        <p>Today we launched the first beta version of the projectlodge.org website. Development continues and will produce a couple more beta versions before the actual release. After the release we will develop the site further in a "Development, Testing, Acceptance, Production" (DTAP) fashion, where the A(cceptance) will be the future beta versions.</p>
        <p>The Railcoach project was started in July 2010 with he creation of the projectlodge website as it's goal. Now this project has matured to the point we'd like to show it to the world. We want to run a continuous development cycle where we want to push out updates rapidly. Updating the site piece by piece. Expect the BETA to become live relatively soon.</p>

        <h3>Founding of the association</h3>
        <p>We have been talking about this during the half year talk. The founding of the projectlodge as a foundation or association. Today we came to concensus with the board and project coördinators about how we want to found the organization.</p>
        <p>Our plan is to start the organization as a association (Dutch: vereniging) based in the netherlands. An association means that we got to have basic rules (statuten) and we need to have members. We choose this form because it is easiest for us to create and allows for changes in the future when we need to.</p>
        <p>Members means that we got to have members that pay an annual fee to have a vote on association issues. Organization membership only gives the member voting rights. Other people that want to be involved in the projects but do not want to be a paying member of the organization are allowed to do this. The only diffrerence from paying members is that they do not have vote rights.</p>
        <p>This is a proposal that will be presented and discussed during the next half year meeting.</p>

        <h3>Second half yearly meeting</h3>
        <p>The half yearly meetings are the opportunity to present the results from various projects, to give lightning talks to probe for interest in new (concept) projects and, of course, to socialize and chat.</p>
        <p>Although mutch has happened during the half year the group has been together, the organization has stood still for a while. With this meeting the board has shown new commitment by taking on a new board member and changing strategy. The board will work together with the project coördinators to work towards the next half yearly meeting.</p>
        <p>All the projects presented their progress during the meeting. The project coördinators gather their progress and presented together with project contributors.</p>
        <p>Read the full report on the meeting on <a href="http://yopefonic.wordpress.com/2011/02/02/projectlodge-meeting-january-2011/">Joost's blog</a>.</p>
